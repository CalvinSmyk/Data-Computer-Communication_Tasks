# Data-Computer-Communication_Tasks
Here are some basic implementations of typical data communication tasks.


# Convert AD Signal to String
This project focuses on converting analog-to-digital (AD) signals to strings. AD signals are continuous and analog in nature, whereas computers can only process digital data. Therefore, this project aims to develop a program that can accurately convert AD signals into digital strings that can be processed by computers.

# Implementation of Go Back N
This project involves the implementation of the Go Back N protocol, which is a flow control mechanism used in network communication. The protocol enables the sender to transmit multiple packets without waiting for an acknowledgement for each packet, thus increasing the overall efficiency of data transmission.

# Hamming Code Implementation
This project aims to implement the Hamming code, which is a technique used for error detection and correction in digital communication. The Hamming code adds extra bits to the data being transmitted, which helps to detect and correct any errors that may have occurred during transmission.

# Medium Trace
The medium trace project involves tracing the path of signals through a communication medium, such as a cable or optical fiber. This can help to identify any problems or bottlenecks in the communication channel, which can then be addressed to improve the overall performance of the system.

# Client and Server Communication
This project involves the development of a program that enables communication between a client and server. The program will allow the client to send requests to the server, which will then respond with the requested data. This type of communication is commonly used in web-based applications and other networked systems.
